Welcome to Feincms Modest's documentation!
==========================================

Modest [#]_ provides a gallery content type for FeinCMS. It can be used
to present a collection of other content types. It is very flexible about
what it can actually present and how it is presented, so the framework
can be used to produce image galleries, pdf file download links or even
product presentations.

It comes with integration for FeinCMS' built in MediaFile content type
and a set of templates to render collections of MediaFiles.
Configuration is made effortless by supporting drag and drop operations
in the admin interface.

.. [#] To keep up the tradition of naming Django related components
       after musicians, this package is named after Модéст Петрóвич Мýсоргский
       for obvious reasons (cue `piano chords <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Modest_Mussorgsky_-_Pictures_at_an_Exhibition,_movement_1.ogg>`_).
