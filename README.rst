=====================
FeinCMS Media Gallery
=====================

This package provides a gallery content type for FeinCMS. It can be used
to present a collection of other content types. It is very flexible about
what it can actually present and how it is presented, so the framework
can be used to produce image galleries, pdf file download links or even
product presentations.

It comes with integration for the MediaFile CT and a set of templates to
render MediaFiles. Configuration is made easy by supporting drag and drop
operations out of the MediaFile admin list.
